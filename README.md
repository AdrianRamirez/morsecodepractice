# morsecodepractice
Python script to practice letters and words listening of Morse code.
It is programmed by default to make a new random letter sound, then display the Morse code text of the letter and then give the option to guess which letter sounded, and repeat.
Based on the code from the Github repository: https://github.com/sinjoysaha/morse-code-player/blob/master/README.md
